# superDigit
This code is written in JavaScript. It repeats a number n times and sums all resulting digits, until only one reminds. This is the super digit that will be printed.

For example:

For n=3 and the number numero=148, the concatenated number will be P=148148148.
Then, the function will sum all the digits as follows:

superDigit(148148148) = 39
superDigit(39) = 12
superDigit(12) =3

Finally, it will print 3.
